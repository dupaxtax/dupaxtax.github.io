                In my free time I enjoy learning new things, watching sports, hiking and camping with my wife, and running. <br>
                I'm an avid reader. I enjoy classics, regular fiction, and anything written by Brandon Sanderson. <br>

            <p>
                I've been working in the software industry since 2016. I've had various roles, from Quality Assurance Specialist <br>
                to Product Manager to Software Engineer. I believe that each position has helped me to better understand the software <br>
                development workflow. <br>
                <br>
                I was fortunate enough to find a position as a software engineer prior to graduating with my bachelors degree. <br>
                Being immersed in a code base as helped me improve my skills greatly. At my current job I work with two other software <br>
                engineers to develop and maintain software used by GPS signal simulators. <br>
                <br>
                I am very lucky to work with a number of types of engineers who teach me about their specific fields and how they <br>
                impact our software. I'm naturally inquisitive and look to learn things from everyone around me.<br>
                <br>
                Up to this point most of my profession experience with code has been with Java and C++. Both of which have helped me <br>
                to understand object oriented programming. Beyond that I've daubbled in Python and Flask to build a website for my <br>
                capstone project at school, as well as to create a machine learning model. In my spare time I've been learning what I <br>
                can about Scala because I find functional programming intriguing.
