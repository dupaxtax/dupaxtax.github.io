            <p>
                I've been working in the software industry since 2016. I've had various roles, from Quality Assurance Specialist <br>
                to Product Manager to Software Engineer. I believe that each position has helped me to better understand the software <br>
                development workflow. <br>
                <br>
                I was fortunate enough to find a position as a software engineer prior to graduating with my bachelors degree. <br>
                Being immersed in a code base as helped me improve my skills greatly. At my current job I work with two other software <br>
                engineers to develop and maintain software used by GPS signal simulators.

                In my free time I enjoy learning new things, watching sports, hiking and camping with my wife, and running. </br>
                I'm an avid reader. I enjoy classics, regular fiction, and anything written by Brandon Sanderson. </br>
